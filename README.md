AlarmClock
==========
This gives the option to query whether a specified time period has expired. The utility is made to have a very low CPU clock cycle cost for the client compared to using StopWatch or std::chrono.

The implementation of AlarmClock was made to be as accurate and efficient as possible. The focus is on low CPU consumption, with the tradeoff of less CPU usage resulting in a less accurate expiration capability. 
 

Expiration time overhead ranges from 50 - 150 microseconds on the current testing platform, when the Alarm clock is checked for expiration in a continuous loop (which normally is not a good usage pattern).

The API usage can be found in: [[AlarmClock.h]](https://github.com/LogRhythm/StopWatch/blob/master/src/AlarmClock.h) and in [[AlarmClockTest.cpp]](https://github.com/LogRhythm/StopWatch/blob/master/test/AlarmClockTest.cpp)


StopWatch
=========

A timer class in C++ which wraps the std::chrono API, with the purpose of retrieving elapsed time since creation of the object or since the timing was restarted. 
Measurements are available in microseconds, milliseconds and seconds.

The API can be found in [[StopWatch.h]](https://github.com/LogRhythm/StopWatch/blob/master/src/StopWatch.h) and example usage can be found in the [[tests]](https://github.com/LogRhythm/StopWatch/blob/master/test/ToolsTestStopWatch.cpp).


ThreadSafeStopWatch
===================

A replacement for `thread_local StopWatch` on platforms that do not have the `thread_local` keyword accessible. It implements the `thread_local` through a `lazy-barber` map access solution.
If `thread_local` is available on your platform then `thread_local StopWatch` is likely a better choice than using the`ThreadSafeStopWatch`
